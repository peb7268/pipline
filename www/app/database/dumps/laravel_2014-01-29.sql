The logo should be exciting and inviting – to motivate people to want to be a part of the insurance industry.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h4 class=\"underline\">Who We Want to Attract</h4>\r\n	<p>The logo should most importantly capture the attention of Millennials who are starting out their careers (primarily ages 18-24).  It should inspire them to want to learn more about potential opportunities available within the insurance field, how their interests and skills could translate to various positions/roles, and to change their perception of the industry overall in a favorable way.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Remember, Millennials are tech savvy and entrepreneurial.  They are well-educated, diverse, non-conformists, confident and accepting.  With social media ever-present, they are well-connected.  They believe that hard work should feel good, meaning they believe in it.  And they are self-advocates, believing they can have what they want if they work hard.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>You should only “invest” in logos that will intrigue these people.</p>\r\n\r\n	<div id=\"centerButtons\">\r\n		<a href=\"\" class=\"styledButton navNextButton\">Continue</a>\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>','2013-12-03 16:31:25','2013-12-04 15:54:41'),

The logo should be exciting and inviting – to motivate people to want to be a part of the insurance industry.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h4 class=\"underline\">Who We Want to Attract</h4>\r\n	<p>The logo should most importantly capture the attention of Millennials who are starting out their careers (primarily ages 18-24).  It should inspire them to want to learn more about potential opportunities available within the insurance field, how their interests and skills could translate to various positions/roles, and to change their perception of the industry overall in a favorable way.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Remember, Millennials are tech savvy and entrepreneurial.  They are well-educated, diverse, non-conformists, confident and accepting.  With social media ever-present, they are well-connected.  They believe that hard work should feel good, meaning they believe in it.  And they are self-advocates, believing they can have what they want if they work hard.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>You should only “invest” in logos that will intrigue these people.</p>\r\n\r\n	<div id=\"centerButtons\">\r\n		<a href=\"\" class=\"styledButton navNextButton\">Continue</a>\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>','2013-12-03 16:31:25','2013-12-04 15:54:41'),

The logo should be exciting and inviting – to motivate people to want to be a part of the insurance industry.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h4 class=\"underline\">Who We Want to Attract</h4>\r\n	<p>The logo should most importantly capture the attention of Millennials who are starting out their careers (primarily ages 18-24).  It should inspire them to want to learn more about potential opportunities available within the insurance field, how their interests and skills could translate to various positions/roles, and to change their perception of the industry overall in a favorable way.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Remember, Millennials are tech savvy and entrepreneurial.  They are well-educated, diverse, non-conformists, confident and accepting.  With social media ever-present, they are well-connected.  They believe that hard work should feel good, meaning they believe in it.  And they are self-advocates, believing they can have what they want if they work hard.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>You should only “invest” in logos that will intrigue these people.</p>\r\n\r\n	<div id=\"centerButtons\">\r\n		<a href=\"\" class=\"styledButton navNextButton\">Continue</a>\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>','2013-12-03 16:31:25','2013-12-04 15:54:41'),

None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of Intengo, its agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized officer of Intengo. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion.</li>\r\n			<li>4.3.

None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of Intengo, its agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized officer of Intengo. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion.</li>\r\n			<li>4.3. If Intengo employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or in relation to this Agreement, and prevails in such matter, Intengo shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\'s fees.
